# IS120project2

SAY HELLO TO PROJECT 2!
Welcome to Project 2! This project will be a continuation of the first project,
but with a few new requirements and optional tasks. It will have a particular
focus on Grid, responsive design, web accessibility, and clever CSS
animations.

I would recommend starting this project by copying all your code and assets
from Project 1 into an entirely new folder for Project 2, and initializing a new
Git repository for the second project. This way, you can keep your old project
intact and have a fresh start for this project. You can also choose to continue
working on your Project 1 repository if you prefer, just make sure you have a
clear separation between the two projects.

If you decide to continue with your Project 1 repository, make sure to create a
new branch for Project 2 so that you can keep your Project 1 code intact. You
can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
git checkout -b branch-name
Where branch-name is the name of the new branch you want to create. You
can then push this branch to GitHub by running.

Project Description

Using the product page you created in Project 1, you will now redesign the
page using mobile-first design principles. This means that you will design
the page for mobile devices first, and then use media queries (and/or other
techniques) to adjust the design for larger screens.

Grading

This project will be worth 10% of your semester total grade.
The grading of the project will be divided into 2 distinctions, required and
optional tasks. The required tasks will account for 35 points, while the
optional tasks will account for up to 20 points. You may choose to do as
many optional tasks as you would like, but the maximum grade possible on
the project is 100%; a 50 out of 50 equates to 100% on the project. A
maximum of 5% may be used as "bonus" for points lost on the required
tasks. No student will receive more than 100% on the project.

Task Breakdown

Required Tasks (up to 35 points)
[10pts] Full mobile responsivity through media queries and flexible layouts
to ensure the site looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
[8pts] Strategic use of CSS Grid for at least one major section of your page
[7pts] Implementation of at least 2 CSS animations (transitions, keyframes,
or transform properties)
[5pts] Meet all requirements from the HTML Semantics Checklist found here
[3pts] Create at least one accessible component (form, navigation, etc.)
using ARIA roles and other accessibility best practices
[2pts] Initialize a new Git repository for the project (or continue with your
Project 1 repository), make regular commits to show your progress, and have
your website live on GitHub Pages

Optional Tasks (up to 20 points)

[8pts] Create a responsive navigation menu that converts to a hamburger
menu on mobile devices
[6pts] Two instances of using a tool or skill that was taught by your peers in
our UTD presentations (3pts each)
[5pts] Include a parallax scrolling effect
[5pts] Implement auto-filling or auto-fitting grid layouts with
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(size, 1fr))
[4pts] Implement CSS Grid template areas for your page layout and use
them to reorganize content at different breakpoints
[4pts] Create and implement a dark mode toggle using CSS custom
properties (variables)
[2pts] Implement a "sticky" element that uses position: sticky
[2pts] Use the CSS object-fit property to handle responsive images elegantly
[2pts] Use CSS Grid's named lines feature to create a complex layout
[2pts] Implement smooth scrolling behavior site-wide or for specific
elements
[1pts] Use CSS gap property effectively with both Grid and Flexbox layouts
[1pt] Add custom focus states to interactive elements for keyboard
accessibility

A Reminder of AI Usage
I will always encourage the use of AI to help you with your coursework, but
be wise and accountable in its use. For each instance that AI is used, you
must disclose it in the comments of your code with a date stamp and the
prompt you provided the AI with. In general, you may use AI to help you with
the design of your website, but the content must be original to you.
Submission

Following your completion of the project, submit a PDF of the completed
form on the last page of this document, with a description of how the
project went for you. The PDF should be named
"Firstname-Lastname-Project2.pdf" and submitted to the appropriate
Project 2 assignment on Learning Suite. Included in the submission
comments should be a link to your GitHub repository for the project. If you
decide to continue from your original Project 1 code and branch off that
repository, be sure to include which branch we should grade in the grading
submission form as well.

Good luck and have fun with this project!
